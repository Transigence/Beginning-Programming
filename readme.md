# Beginning Programming
## Preface
Programming computers is not a beginner-friendly endeavor. Part of the problem is that, unlike most other pursuits, there is no clear beginning. There are many places that are _the beginning_, as it were. In order to begin, you must become a novice in seven key areas all at once. They are:
* The environment
* The toolchain
* The run-time
* The grammar and syntax
* The namespaces, libraries and/or modules
* Programming fundamentals
* Reading Documentation

This makes learning to code a daunting task to the uninitiated. Now that you know this, it should all be far less scary. The purpose of this essay is to give the reader a general understanding of the lay of the land, so he or she can direct his or her efforts sensibly without any undue frustration. If you have read this far, then you are already much more equipped to begin learning to program than you were before.

In the following chapters, I will describe to you _what_ these things are, as well as some other helpful topics as this document evolves. However, I will not focus on teaching you the material itself. That is your endeavor, which varies according to a whole slew of decisions that you must make. There is no shortage of tutorials, documents, and other explanatory works on these matters. It is only important that you know what these things are so that you know you must learn them, and why.
