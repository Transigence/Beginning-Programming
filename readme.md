# Beginning Programming
Programming computers is not a beginner-friendly endeavor. Part of the problem is that, unlike most other pursuits, there is no clear beginning. There are many places that are _the beginning_, as it were. In order to begin, you must become a novice in six key areas:
* The environment
* The toolchain
* The run-time
* The grammar/syntax
* Programming fundamentals
* Documentation-reading
